My objective is to make neural networks efficient and robust. We all notice that there is a huge gap between human and neural networks in terms of generalization ability and efficiency. To close the gap, we need to solve the problem of robustness and over-parameterization. 

I am currently working as a full time researcher at IIISCT, founded by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao. My primary research responsibility is compressing neural networks and ensuring models' robustness. My work on model compression and robustness are accepted by top conferences such as ICCV,ECCV,and ASPLOS.
